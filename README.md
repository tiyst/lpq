# lpq - League Pop Quiz (Very much WIP)
_main_ being a release branch, contains only the latest, most stable version of lpq. For most up to date version tha might have experimental features and not so thoroughly tested version checkout _dev_ branch.

A webapp inspired by the LEC Pop Quiz, a content series by LEC, a European regional league for League of Legends esports.

The web app strives to imitate the game pro players partake in in these content pieces, in your own time with randomly generated questions (Not by an AI, sorry VCs).

Support for multiplayer rooms planned, so you can play with your friends in a custom room and compete for the title of most addicted league player in your friend group.
